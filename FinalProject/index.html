      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <section>
        Prep:
        <ol>
          <li>Season the salmon fillets with salt, pepper, and paprika (if using).</li>
          <li>If you choose to thicken the sauce with cornstarch, mix the cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water in a
            small bowl to create a slurry. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Cook:
        <ol>
          <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the salmon fillets and cook for about 3-4
            minutes on each side or until golden and cooked to your preference. Remove the salmon from the skillet and
            set aside.</li>
          <li>In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed, and sautÃ© the garlic and onions until fragrant and the
            onions are translucent about 2-3 minutes.</li>
          <li>Lower the heat to medium and pour in the coconut milk, stirring well. If youâ€™re using the cornstarch
            slurry, add it to the pan now, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens to your liking.</li>
          <li>Add the lemon juice and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
          <li>Return the salmon fillets to the skillet, pour the sauce over them, and cook for another 5 minutes to let
            the flavors meld.</li>
          <li>Garnish with fresh herbs and lemon slices before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Serve the creamy garlic salmon with a side of steamed vegetables, over rice, or with a fresh salad for a
        complete meal.
        <br>
        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure your coconut milk is unsweetened and doesn't contain any added flavors that might conflict with the
            dish.
          <li>You can also add a splash of white wine to the sauce before adding the coconut milk for an extra layer of
            flavor.
          <li>If you have more time and want to infuse the salmon with more flavor, you can marinate it in a mixture of
            olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs for about 15-30 minutes before cooking.

      </section>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <section>
        <Prepare the Toppings:
        Pork: Marinate pork slices in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, garlic, and ginger for 10 minutes. In a pan,
        heat vegetable oil over medium heat and fry the pork until nicely browned on both sides. Set aside.
        Eggs: Boil eggs for 6-7 minutes for a soft-boiled consistency, then place in ice water to stop cooking.
        Peel and set aside.
        Cook the Ramen:
        Follow the instructions on your at-home tonkatsu ramen broth. Usually, this involves boiling the noodles
        separately and mixing them with the soup base that is heated in another pot.
        Assemble the Ramen:
        Place cooked noodles in a bowl. Pour the hot soup over the noodles.
        Add the fried pork slices, cut soft-boiled eggs in half, and place on top.
        Garnish with green onions, a piece of nori, bamboo shoots, or corn.
        Add a drizzle of chili oil or sesame oil if desired.
        Tips:
        <ul>          
          <li>Quality of Broth: Choose a good quality at-home tonkatsu ramen broth base.</li>
          <li>Variations: Feel free to add other toppings like bean sprouts, bok choy, or mushrooms.</li>
          <li>Vegetarian Option: Skip the pork and use tofu or extra vegetables. Look for a vegetarian ramen packet.
          </li>
          <li>Storing: It's best enjoyed fresh. However, you can store the broth and toppings separately in the
            refrigerator for up to 2 days.</li>
